abstract = {This paper describes Slither, a static analysis framework designed to provide rich information about Ethereum smart contracts. It works by converting Solidity smart contracts into an intermediate representation called SlithIR. SlithIR uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) form and a reduced instruction set to ease implementation of analyses while preserving semantic information that would be lost in transforming Solidity to bytecode. Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review.In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives. We compared tools using a large dataset of smart contracts and manually reviewed results for 1000 of the most used contracts.},

abstract = {Any static, global analysis of the expression and data relationships in a program requires a knowledge of the control flow of the program. Since one of the primary reasons for doing such a global analysis in a compiler is to produce optimized programs, control flow analysis has been embedded in many compilers and has been described in several papers. An early paper by Prosser [5] described the use of Boolean matrices (or, more particularly, connectivity matrices) in flow analysis. The use of “dominance” relationships in flow analysis was first introduced by Prosser and much expanded by Lowry and Medlock [6]. References [6,8,9] describe compilers which use various forms of control flow analysis for optimization. Some recent developments in the area are reported in [4] and in [7].The underlying motivation in all the different types of control flow analysis is the need to codify the flow relationships in the program. The codification may be in connectivity matrices, in predecessor-successor tables, in dominance lists, etc. Whatever the form, the purpose is to facilitate determining what the flow relationships are; in other words to facilitate answering such questions as: is this an inner loop?, if an expression is removed from the loop where can it be correctly and profitably placed?, which variable definitions can affect this use?In this paper the basic control flow relationships are expressed in a directed graph. Various graph constructs are then found and shown to codify interesting global relationships.},
